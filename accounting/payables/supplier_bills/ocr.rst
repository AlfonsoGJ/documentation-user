Digitalize your Vendor Bills with Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
=====================================================================

Encoding your bills manually can be a time-consuming task. Being able to digitalize them and
extract the data into your database automatically will allow you to reduce errors, save time and
have an effortless process.

Set up the feature
==================

Go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Settings --> Bill Digitalization`, and choose whether the bills
should be processed automatically or manually.

Start digitalizing your bills
-----------------------------

Scan your bills and then go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Vendors --> Bills` and upload your
document. Based on your configuration, it will either be processed automatically, or you will need
to click on *Send for Digitalization* to do it manually.

.. tip::
   You can also create a vendor bill through the *Documents* app or by using an email alias on your
   journals.

Once the data is extracted from the PDF, you can correct it if necessary by clicking on the
respective tag (available in *Edit* mode), and selecting the right information instead.

   The more bills you scan, the better the system will get at identifying the correct data.
