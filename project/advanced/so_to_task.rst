Create Projects and Tasks from Sales Orders
===========================================

When you sell your services, you can choose to automatically have a project/task created, helping
you not to lose track of the work that needs to get done, and to streamline processes between teams.
In addition to that, you will be able to invoice or reinvoice clients according to the exact time
spent on that service.

Product set up
==============

| Under :menuselection:`Sales --> Products --> Products` create a new product or set up an existing
  one. Under *General Information* set the *Product Type* as *Service*. Under the *Sales* tab select
  the *Service Invoicing Policy* and *Service Tracking*.
| If you choose to:

- *Create a task in an existing project*: a task will be added in the first column of the selected
  project.
- *Create a task in sales orderâ€™s project*: a new project for each sales order of that service will
  be created based on the template you have chosen.
- *Create a new project but no task*: will only create a new project, for each time that service is
  sold, based on the skeleton of the project template chosen.

Confirm a quotation and have a project/task created

Now, once a *Quotation* is confirmed and transformed into a *Sales Order*, a project or task
will automatically be created.

Tracking* options chosen), will be shown:
