======================
Request a down payment
======================

A down payment is a partial payment made by the buyer when a sales contract is concluded. This
implies a significant commitment from both parties (seller and buyer) who must honor the contract.
Indeed, the buyer shows his will to acquire the product by the down payment and agrees to pay the
rest later, while the seller is obliged to provide the goods by accepting it.

Sometimes a down payment is required for expensive orders or projects. That way, you can protect
yourself and make sure that your customer is serious.

First time you request a down payment
=====================================

When a sales order is confirmed, you will then have the possibility to create an invoice. Invoices
will be automatically created in drafts so that you can review them before validation. To create an
invoice, Odoo Sales will offer you 3 options:

- Regular invoice
- Down payment (percentage)
- Down payment (fixed amount)

In terms of down payment, it can either be a fixed amount or a percentage of the total amount. The
first time you will request a down payment you will be able to put the percentage or the fixed
amount of your choice, select an income account and taxes to precise your down payment. These
settings will be reused for future down payments.

.. important::
   When you request your first down payment, a new product called **Down payment** will be created.
   This product will be registered as a **service** product with an invoicing policy of
   **ordered quantities**. As a reminder, you can edit this product and modify it at any time.
   Please note that if you choose **delivered quantities** as invoicing policy,
   **you will not be able to create an invoice**.

Basic sales flow using down payments
====================================

For this first example, we will use a 50% amount down payment with a product using an
**ordered quantities** as invoicing policy. Be sure to check out our documentation about invoicing
policies here: :doc:`invoicing_policy` to facilitate your use of this feature. When it comes to
create and view the invoice, you will only have access to a draft invoice mentioning the down
payment (as you can see below).

There, you can post the invoice and register the payment of your customer. But, we all know that in
real life this flow does not happen immediately. So, for now, you can return to the sales order.
There, you will have the possibility to see the order as a customer with the **Customer preview**
button or to reach easily the previous draft invoice with the **Invoice** button. In any case, the
down payment will be mentioned on both (sales order and draft invoice).

To complete the flow, if the customer wants to pay the rest of his sales order, you must create
another invoice. Once again, you will have the choice to make another down payment or to deduct all
the down payments and so, paying the rest of the invoice as a regular invoice.

This flow is possible also with a down payment taking into account a fixed amount.

.. important::
   Be careful that if you do a down payment with a product using a **delivered quantities** as
   invoicing policy, you wonâ€™t be able to deduct all the down payments when it comes to invoice your
   customer. Indeed, you have to deliver a product before creating the final invoice. If nothing has
   been delivered, you will create a **credit note** that will cancel the draft invoice created
   after down payment. To do so, you have to install the **Inventory App** to confirm the delivery
   or you have to enter manually the delivered quantity on the sales order.

Modify the income account and customer taxes
============================================

From the products list, search for the **Down Payment** product.

You can edit it and under the **General Information Tab** you will be able to change the customer
taxes. Now, to change the income account, you will need to install the **Accounting App** to have
the possibility to see the **Accounting Tab** on the product form.
